I'm reading Eric S. Roberts' "Programming Abstractions in C: A Second Course in Computer Science". Yea, I know, I've barely started two other C books. But my CSE214 class has taught me one thing: Java is not a language with which to learn data structures & algorithms.

I'm currently on page 20 (out of the 743 that I plan to read; Chapter 17, 'Looking Ahead to Java', is getting skipped)
