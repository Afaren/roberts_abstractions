Programming Abstractions in C: A Second Course in Computer Science
======================================

Intro
-----
I'm reading Eric S. Roberts' [Programming Abstractions in C: A Second Course in Computer Science](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~eroberts/books/ProgrammingAbstractionsInC/). Yea, I know, I've barely started [two](http://github.com/mblair/a_book_on_c) [other](http://github.com/mblair/c_aiwaa) C books. But my [CSE214](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~cse214/) class has taught me one thing: Java is not a language with which to learn data structures & algorithms. Even [cperciva](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1748572) thinks so!

Hacking
-------
In order for the code samples to work, you need to run `make` in the `book_code/unix-xwindows` directory first. I'm using [Clang 2.8](http://clang.llvm.org/), so I've modified the Makefile accordingly and have rewritten Roberts' gccx wrapper script, now called `roberts_clang`. Symlink that into `/usr/local/bin` and you're set.

Progress
--------
I'm currently on page 20 (out of the 743 that I plan to read; Chapter 17, 'Looking Ahead to Java', is getting skipped). I'll be writing chapter notes on my [blog, once it's set up](matthewblair.net).
